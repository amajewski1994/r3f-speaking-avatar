# R3F Speaking Avatar

Live demo: https://amajewski1994.github.io/r3f-speaking-avatar/

A React Three Fiber (R3F) app featuring a 3D avatar (`.glb`) that represents a virtual version of myself.
Although the avatar does not reflect my real appearance, it answers selected questions as if I were answering them personally, using text-to-speech.

Questions are displayed as floating, clickable planes in the 3D scene.

The backend API is built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, and is hosted on **Heroku**.
